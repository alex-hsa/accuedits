# AccuEdits Web Builder

![Accuedits logo](https://www.accuedits.com/logo_accuedits.png)

AccuEdits is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) to organize styles. This encourages a
component-based approach to theming through the creation of discrete, reusable
UI elements. AccuEdits is heavily integrated with
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and the [Storybook module](https://www.drupal.org/project/storybook), allowing Drupal
and Storybook to share the same markup.
