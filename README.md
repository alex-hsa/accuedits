AccuEdits is a robust website builder that empowers content creators to efficiently produce, publish, and maintain content with unparalleled speed and ease.

AccuEdits uses a content-first approach which focuses on prioritizing content creation and structure before considering design or technical implementation.

AccuEdits leverages [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com/) to organize styles. This encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of discrete, reusable UI elements.

AccuEdits is heavily integrated with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and the [Storybook module](https://www.drupal.org/project/storybook), allowing Drupal and Storybook to share the same markup.
